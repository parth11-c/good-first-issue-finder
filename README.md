## 🌍 Live Website
👉 [Good First Issue Finder](https://finder.eddiehub.org)

---

## 📋 Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed before setup:  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  
- [Node.js (LTS Recommended)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  

---

## ⚡ Installation
1. **Fork** the project [here](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/good-first-issue-finder/fork)  
2. **Clone** your forked repo  
   → `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/good-first-issue-finder.git`  
3. Navigate to the project folder  
   → `cd good-first-issue-finder`  
4. Install dependencies  
   → `npm install`  
5. If you get a **Node/NPM version error**, update Node:  
   - [Download LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
   - Or [update via CLI](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-update-node-js-and-npm-to-next-version/)  
6. Create a `.env` file in the root and add your **GitHub OAuth** values (see `.env.example`).  
   > **OAuth App Setup:**  
   - Go to [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)  
   - Callback URL → `http://localhost:5173/api/authentication/callback`  
   - ⚠️ Never commit your `.env` file!  
   ![callback url](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75534912/191059977-48962f25-4a83-4564-9a17-019ab0783a40.jpg)  
7. Start the app 🚀  
   → `npm run dev`  

💡 Alternatively, skip setup and use:  
[![Gitpod Ready-to-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/good-first-issue-finder)  
⚠️ You’ll still need to configure `.env` (Step 6).
